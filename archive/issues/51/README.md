To keep an open, append-only corpus of assets synced seamlessly across Android/iOS phones and laptops without relying on centralized corporate clouds or single points of failure, Syncthing combined with Obsidian (or plain folder structures) is your best solution.
It creates a zero-trust, local-first, peer-to-peer (P2P) mesh network across all your devices.
1. Core Architecture: Peer-to-Peer Mesh (Syncthing)
Syncthing is an open-source, continuous file synchronization program. It replaces proprietary cloud services with encrypted P2P communication.
 * Zero Central Server: Files sync directly device-to-device over local Wi-Fi or encrypted internet relays. If one phone goes offline, the rest of the network keeps syncing.
 * Cross-Platform Support: Runs natively on Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux. For iOS, use Mobius Sync (a fully compatible Syncthing wrapper).
 * Selective & Master Nodes: You can set laptops as "Send & Receive" storage hubs and set phones to "Send Only" (e.g., photo drop nodes) or "Selective Sync" so phone storage isn't instantly maxed out by large MP4s.
 * E2E Encryption: All traffic between devices is encrypted with TLS. You can even set "untrusted nodes" (e.g., a cheap VPS or home server) that hold encrypted copies without being able to read your files.
2. Multi-Device File Pipeline
To handle your specific file types without corruption or merge conflicts:
 * Photos & Videos (JPEGs, PNGs, MP4s):
   * Set up a dedicated /Media-Drop folder on your main phone.
   * Use an app like Obsidian or FolderSync (Android) to auto-copy new camera photos straight into that folder.
   * Syncthing immediately pushes those files to your laptops and secondary phones.
 * Documents & Text (PDFs, Markdown, MP3s):
   * Keep your text notes and petition drafts in standard Markdown (.md).
   * Point Obsidian (free, offline-first Markdown reader/editor) to your synced folder on both phones and laptops. This gives you a searchable, interconnected knowledge base across every device.
3. Alternative & Hybrid Options
| Tool | Model | Strengths | Ideal Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| Syncthing + Mobius | Pure P2P (Local Mesh) | Zero costs, encrypted, unlimited file sizes, no third-party servers. | Primary setup for raw media, PDFs, MP3s/MP4s, and Markdown. |
| Tailscale + File Shares | Mesh VPN + SMB/NFS | Connects all devices into a private virtual network. | Mounting a single laptop's hard drive securely onto your phones from anywhere. |
| Nextcloud (Self-Hosted) | Private Server / Client | Google Drive alternative; includes web access and instant camera upload. | If you want a single central server accessible via web browsers. |
Immediate Setup Steps
 * Install Syncthing on your primary laptop and Syncthing (Android) or Mobius Sync (iOS) on your phone.
 * Pair the devices using a QR code scan inside the app.
 * Create a folder named Provo42-Corpus on your laptop and share it with the phone.
 * Test the pipeline: Take a photo on your phone, save it to the shared folder, and verify it appears on your laptop within seconds.
Does your current hardware fleet include a dedicated stationary device (like a home PC or server) to act as an always-on relay, or are all devices mobile and moving between networks?

Here is how to wire that exact hardware fleet into an automated, zero-cloud sync engine:
Fleet Mapping & Storage Allocation
 * MacBook (16GB RAM): Primary Master Node. Acts as the central vault, running Syncthing and Obsidian. Holds the full corpus (PDFs, high-res MP4s, audio drops, full resolution photo archives).
 * Two Old Windows Notebooks: Always-On Static Relays. Strip these down, install Syncthing, plug them into power/Ethernet, and leave them running continuously. They act as local backup servers and encrypted relay points so your phones can sync even when the MacBook is closed.
 * Galaxy S23: Power Mobile Node. Runs Syncthing (Android) and Obsidian. Full two-way sync for Markdown, PDFs, and MP3s; auto-pushes camera photos straight to the network.
 * Galaxy A17: Secondary / Field Drop Node. Runs Syncthing-Fork (lightweight Android build). Configured to auto-push media to the Windows relays without storing the entire heavy video corpus locally.
 * Feature Phone (Nokia-style w/ Bluetooth): Air-Gapped Asset Drop. Cannot run background sync apps. Use its microSD card as a physical air-gap bridge, or use Bluetooth Object Push (OPP) to beam JPEGs/audio directly to the S23 or A17, which then auto-ingest the files into the Syncthing folder.
Step-by-Step Infrastructure Deployment
1. Establish the Relay Anchor (Old Windows Laptops)
 * Format or clean up both Windows notebooks.
 * Install Syncthing and set them to start automatically on boot.
 * Create a single root folder: C:\Provo42-Corpus\.
2. Pair the Mesh Network
 * Open the Syncthing Web UI ([http://127.0.0.1:8384](http://127.0.0.1:8384)) on the MacBook and S23.
 * Scan the Device ID QR codes to link: MacBook ↔ Windows Relays ↔ S23 ↔ A17.
 * Every device now talks directly to every other device on the local Wi-Fi or over encrypted peer-to-peer relays when out in the field.
3. Configure Automated Mobile Photo Ingestion (S23 & A17)
 * On the Android phones, open Syncthing and add a new folder pointing to /DCIM/Camera/.
 * Set folder type to Send Only.
 * Share this folder with the Windows Relays and MacBook.
 * Result: Every photo or video snapped on the street automatically lands on your MacBook and backup laptops the second the phone touches Wi-Fi or mobile data.
4. Bridge the Feature Phone
 * Option A (MicroSD Swap): Save photos directly to a microSD card in the feature phone. Pop the card into the A17 or a USB reader on a Windows notebook to offload.
 * Option B (Bluetooth Ingest): Pair the feature phone with the A17 via Bluetooth. Beam photos over. Set the A17's /Bluetooth/ download folder as a Syncthing watch directory so incoming files immediately replicate across the entire network.
Recommended Folder Structure (Provo42-Corpus)
Provo42-Corpus/
├── 01_Petitions/           <-- Markdown (.md) drafts & DOI Zenodo metadata
├── 02_Media_Drops/         <-- Raw JPEGs, PNGs from S23, A17, & Bluetooth
├── 03_Audio_Vault/         <-- MP3s, WAVs, DJ intros, track stems
├── 04_Video_Assets/        <-- MP4s (Synced to MacBook & Windows only)
└── 05_Research_PDFs/       <-- Legal frameworks, IND filings, papers

Which old Windows notebook should we set up as the primary stationary relay first, or do you want to test pairing the S23 and the MacBook right now?

**Solid, practical zero-cloud architecture.** This is one of the better real-world Syncthing + Obsidian deployments I've seen for a mixed mobile/laptop fleet that prioritizes local-first, no corporate cloud, and resilience.

### Strengths
- **True P2P mesh with redundancy**: Using the two old Windows notebooks as always-on static relays is the key upgrade. Pure phone + MacBook setups often stall when the laptop is closed or someone is off-network. The relays give you a quasi-always-available hub without introducing a single point of failure or a central server you have to maintain heavily.
- **Role-based folder types**: Send-Only for the camera folders on the S23/A17 is exactly right. Selective sync / limited folders on the lighter A17 prevents the phones from getting crushed by the full video/PDF corpus. Master/full sync on the MacBook + relays is correct.
- **Feature phone bridge**: MicroSD swap or Bluetooth OPP → watched folder on the A17 is pragmatic. Feature phones are intentionally limited; treating them as air-gapped drop points instead of forcing apps is the right call.
- **Folder structure**: Clean, purpose-separated, and Obsidian-friendly. Markdown-first for petitions/notes + dedicated media drops scales well and avoids the usual “everything in one giant folder” mess.
- **Encryption & untrusted nodes**: Mentioning untrusted nodes (encrypted blobs only) is smart if you ever add a cheap VPS or friend’s machine later.

### Practical caveats & improvements
1. **Relay reliability**  
   Old Windows notebooks left running 24/7 will eventually have thermal, disk, or Windows Update issues.  
   - Prefer Linux (Debian/Ubuntu minimal or even a lightweight Proxmox/LXC) if you’re willing to reimage one.  
   - Or keep Windows but: disable sleep, set Syncthing as a service, auto-login or run as service, and put the drives on a simple UPS.  
   - Monitor free space and disk health; media drops grow fast.

2. **iOS gap**  
   The original post correctly notes Mobius Sync. If any iOS device appears later, treat it as second-class (limited background, battery, folder access) compared with Android Syncthing-Fork / official.

3. **Conflict & versioning**  
   Syncthing is excellent at continuous sync but not a full version-control system. For the Markdown petition/legal drafts, consider:
   - Git inside the Obsidian vault (or a dedicated repo) for the text-heavy folders, or
   - Syncthing’s versioning (simple or staggered) on the MacBook/relays so you can recover from accidental overwrites or bad phone edits.

4. **Photo pipeline polish**  
   Directly sharing `/DCIM/Camera` as Send-Only works, but some people prefer a dedicated “Inbox” or “Camera-Drop” folder that an automation (FolderSync, Tasker, or even Obsidian’s own plugins / Android intents) copies into, then lets Syncthing handle the rest. Keeps the real camera roll cleaner and gives you a chance to rename/organize before it hits the vault.

5. **Bandwidth & mobile data**  
   When phones are on cellular, large video syncs can be expensive or slow. Use Syncthing’s folder ignores, bandwidth limits, or “only sync on Wi-Fi” where possible on the A17. The MacBook + relays should be the places that hold the full high-res video set.

6. **Security hygiene**
   - Device IDs and sharing should stay on the local network or via relays you control; avoid permanent public introduction servers if paranoia is high.
   - Strong device passwords + full-disk encryption on the Windows boxes and MacBook.
   - Periodic review of which devices still have access.

### Bottom line
This is a high-quality, low-dependency setup that actually matches the stated goals (open, append-only corpus, no centralized clouds, works across the described hardware). The two always-on Windows relays turn it from “works when everything is online and the Mac is open” into something far more robust.

I’d start by pairing the MacBook + S23 first (quick win, validates the photo pipeline), then bring the first Windows notebook online as the primary stationary relay, then the second. Once those three are solid, add the A17 and the feature-phone bridge.

If the goal is maximum resilience with minimal ongoing babysitting, this is already in the top tier of practical local-first media + notes meshes.

**Yes — this is very doable and fits cleanly with your existing Syncthing + folder structure.**

Zenodo’s REST API is mature enough for exactly the pattern you described: “for period X–Y, here are the artifacts.” You end up with a proper DOI (and a concept DOI that groups versions if you keep doing this monthly/weekly).

### Practical constraints (important)
- **50 GB total / 100 files per record** (hard limits right now).  
  More than ~20–30 files → package into one or a few ZIP archives.  
  Videos and high-res photo dumps will hit the size limit fast, so plan to either:
  - Split by type (one deposit for media drops, one for documents/audio), or
  - Keep only the most important subset + a manifest of what was excluded.
- Publishing is permanent (you can still create new versions later).
- Test everything on the **sandbox** first (`https://sandbox.zenodo.org`).

### Recommended semi-automated workflow

**1. Trigger / selection**
On the MacBook (master node), a small script or Obsidian command that accepts:
- start date / end date (or “last 7 days”, “September 2026”, etc.)
- optional filters (only `02_Media_Drops`, only Markdown + PDFs, exclude videos > X MB, etc.)

It walks the relevant folders in `Provo42-Corpus/` and selects files by modification time (or by a simple naming convention if you start using one).

**2. Packaging**
- Create a temporary staging directory.
- Copy (or hard-link) the selected files.
- Generate a simple `manifest.txt` or `manifest.csv` (filename, size, original path, capture time).
- Zip everything (or zip by category: `media.zip`, `documents.zip`, `audio.zip`).  
  Zipping keeps you under the 100-file limit and makes the deposit cleaner.

**3. Deposit via API**
Standard flow (Python `requests` is the most common):

1. Create empty deposit → get `id` + `bucket` URL.
2. Upload the ZIP(s) + manifest to the bucket (new bucket API is preferred for larger files).
3. PUT metadata:
   - `title`: e.g. `Provo42 Corpus – 2026-09-01 to 2026-09-10`
   - `upload_type`: `dataset` (or `other` / `image` if mostly media)
   - `description`: short paragraph + link back to your local structure / any petition context
   - `creators`, `keywords`, `publication_date`, license (CC-BY or whatever you prefer), communities if you have one
4. Publish → Zenodo mints the DOI.
5. (Optional) Immediately create a new version later if you need to add more files.

You can reserve a DOI in advance if you want the DOI string to appear inside the files themselves before publishing.

**4. Feedback loop**
After publish, the script writes the DOI + record URL into a small Markdown note in your vault (e.g. `01_Petitions/Zenodo-Deposits.md` or a dedicated log). That way Obsidian stays the single source of truth.

### Implementation options (from lightest to more polished)

| Approach | Effort | Good for |
|----------|--------|----------|
| One-off Python script + cron / manual run | Low | Starting now |
| Python script wrapped as an Obsidian plugin / Templater / shell command | Medium | Daily/weekly use from the vault |
| Existing helpers (`zenodo-client`, `zenodo-deposit` CLI, etc.) + thin wrapper | Medium | Less code to maintain |
| Full local web UI or simple CLI with date-range picker | Higher | If multiple people will trigger deposits |

I can sketch a clean, minimal Python script that does the date-range selection + ZIP + full deposit + DOI logging if you want. It would live on the MacBook, read from the synced `Provo42-Corpus` folders, and only need a Zenodo personal access token (with `deposit:write` + `deposit:actions`).

### Quick decisions that help a lot
- Do you want **one deposit per time window** (everything mixed) or **split by type** (media vs documents)?
- Typical window size? (daily / weekly / monthly)
- Should videos always be included, or only on request / lower resolution?
- Preferred license and creator name(s) for the metadata?
- Do you already have a Zenodo community, or just personal deposits?

Once those are clear, the automation becomes almost mechanical and stays fully under your control — no third-party cloud involved beyond Zenodo itself (which is the point of getting the DOIs).

> attogram: One thing we have to do for everything that's incoming is a PII scrub , personal identifiable information . We have to be totally clean , you know? GDPR compliant, ISO 2 whatever compliant. So we need a step here that says a human must review for PII.

**Yes — make human PII review a hard gate, not an afterthought.**

Everything that enters the long-term corpus (and especially anything that will receive a DOI on Zenodo) must pass through a mandatory human review step. No automatic “scrub and publish.” The system should *assist* the review, never replace it.

### Recommended pipeline addition

Add two new folders under `Provo42-Corpus/`:

```
Provo42-Corpus/
├── 00_Inbox/                  ← everything lands here first (Syncthing Send-Only from phones, Bluetooth drops, etc.)
├── 00_Review_Queue/           ← files waiting for human PII check
├── 00_Quarantine/             ← rejected / needs more work
├── 01_Petitions/
├── 02_Media_Drops/            ← only cleaned, approved material
├── 03_Audio_Vault/
├── 04_Video_Assets/
└── 05_Research_PDFs/
```

**Flow**

1. **Ingest**  
   All incoming files (camera, Bluetooth, feature-phone SD, etc.) land in `00_Inbox/` (or a per-device subfolder).

2. **Auto-stage for review**  
   A simple watcher / script moves new files into `00_Review_Queue/` and creates a short review ticket (Markdown note) with:
   - original filename + path
   - capture time / device
   - file type + size
   - suggested destination folder
   - checklist of common PII risks

3. **Human review gate (non-negotiable)**  
   Someone must explicitly mark the file (or batch) as:
   - **Approved** → move to the correct clean folder (`02_Media_Drops/`, etc.)
   - **Needs redaction** → stay in queue or move to a working area
   - **Reject / Quarantine** → `00_Quarantine/`

   Only after this human sign-off does the file become part of the permanent corpus or eligible for a Zenodo deposit.

4. **Zenodo step**  
   The deposit script only ever looks at the *clean* folders. It should refuse to package anything that still has a “pending review” flag.

### Practical tooling that stays local-first

- **Obsidian** is already perfect for the review tickets.  
  One note per batch or per day with checkboxes, reviewer name, timestamp, and notes (“faces blurred”, “license plate removed”, “audio segment muted”, etc.).

- Light automation helpers (still local):
  - Filename / EXIF scrubbing suggestions (strip GPS, camera serial, etc.)
  - Simple face/license-plate detection *as a flag*, never as auto-redaction
  - Audio waveform or transcript flags for spoken names/numbers
  - PDF text extraction for obvious personal data

  These tools only generate *warnings* and a review checklist. The human still decides and performs (or confirms) any redaction.

- Redaction itself stays manual or semi-manual (Obsidian + external tools, or a simple local script that the reviewer triggers after deciding what to remove).

### Policy rules worth writing down

- No file leaves `00_Review_Queue/` without a human “Approved” mark.
- Reviewer identity + timestamp is recorded (accountability).
- Default posture: when in doubt, quarantine or redact more aggressively.
- Zenodo deposits only pull from the cleaned folders and include a short statement in the description that the material was human-reviewed for personal data.
- Retention of the original (pre-scrub) version is a separate decision — many teams keep it encrypted/offline or delete it after successful review.

### Minimal viable version to start today

1. Create the three control folders (`00_Inbox`, `00_Review_Queue`, `00_Quarantine`).
2. Change the phone Syncthing shares so new photos/videos go into `00_Inbox` instead of straight into `02_Media_Drops`.
3. Make a simple Obsidian template for “PII Review Ticket”.
4. Add a one-line rule in your Zenodo script: “only process files that are outside the 00_* folders and have an accompanying approved review note”.

This keeps the system zero-cloud, auditable, and GDPR-aligned while still letting the rest of the mesh (Syncthing + relays + Obsidian) work as designed.

Want me to sketch the exact folder moves + a minimal review-ticket template + the guard clause for the Zenodo script next?
