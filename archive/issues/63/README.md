# #63: feat: add mobile repository history archive workflow

https://github.com/attogram/THE-ERROR-IS-THE-MESSAGE/pull/63

State: open; created: 2026-09-13T09:07:51Z

Implements #60.

### What this adds

- A manually triggered **Save repository history** GitHub Actions workflow that can be launched from GitHub mobile/web.
- Dependency-free Python export of open/closed issues, pull requests, conversation comments, reviews, inline review comments, releases, tags, release assets, source archives, and GitHub-hosted attachments.
- A dedicated `repository-archive` branch for generated output, so the default branch is not filled with archive data.
- Streaming asset downloads with SHA-256 checksums and 40 MiB Git-friendly chunks for large files.
- A restore helper that reassembles chunked assets and verifies size + SHA-256.
- Explicit incomplete-state handling: API/download failures are recorded in `manifest.json`, the partial archive is still preserved, and the workflow fails visibly instead of reporting a false success.
- Credential-safe downloads: the token is sent only to `api.github.com` and removed on cross-host redirects.

### Validation

```text
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v   # 14 tests
python -m py_compile tools/repo_dump.py tools/repo_restore.py
git diff --check
```

No generated repository dump is included in this PR. After merge, running the workflow creates/updates the `repository-archive` branch and can be used directly against this repository for the acceptance demonstration.
