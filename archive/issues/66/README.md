# #66: Add a resumable repository archive with checksummed media and manual Actions

https://github.com/attogram/THE-ERROR-IS-THE-MESSAGE/pull/66

State: open; created: 2026-09-13T09:43:08Z

Adds a dependency-free Python archive and a manual Actions workflow for the repository data requested in #60. It saves paginated issues, PR conversations/reviews, releases and tags, root-README text, and GitHub-hosted attachments to a dedicated archive branch. Raw JSON, readable HTML, source-to-file mappings, sizes and SHA-256 checksums are retained. Reruns reuse verified files; budget exhaustion or missing assets remain explicit failures. Large media is stored in parts below GitHub's per-file limit.

Actual local execution on this repository (09:20 UTC) saved 60 issues, 4 PRs, 167 conversation comments, 4 releases/tags and 399 attachment URLs in 400 parts, totaling 1,880,901,820 bytes with zero failures. Independent streaming verification matched every file and part; 14 tests pass. The archive index and issue #60 were exercised in a real browser.

- Published archive: https://github.com/Manntouu/scaffolds/tree/bounty/repository-archive-data/repository-dump
- Usage and scope: tools/REPOSITORY_ARCHIVE.md
- Validation record: tools/VALIDATION.md

The fork was initially blocked by GitHub server errors and is now available. Hosted Actions execution and mobile triggering are still being validated; the evidence above is the completed local run and published archive, not a hosted-run claim. Deleted/inaccessible content and separate GitHub Discussions, wikis, projects and Actions artifacts are outside this export.

AI-assisted implementation and validation by Codex, authorized for @Manntouu. Please review for the stated €100 bounty; no award or payment is assumed. The payout-method question is in #60.
