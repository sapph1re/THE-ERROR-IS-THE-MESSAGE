From Verified Workflow to Hallucinated Procedure: A Case Study in Assistant Failure During Zenodo Community Association

Introduction

This paper analyzes a sequence of assistant errors occurring during troubleshooting of a specific digital-preservation workflow: automatic archival of GitHub releases into Zenodo, followed by association of those Zenodo records with a particular Zenodo Community.

The user's operational requirement was narrow and unambiguous:

> A release made in GitHub should automatically produce a Zenodo record, and that record should automatically become part of the Rock Street Zenodo Community.



The first half of this workflow was already demonstrably successful. The repository had produced multiple successful Zenodo deposits and corresponding DOIs. The only unresolved problem was community association.

The interaction subsequently deteriorated because the assistant repeatedly substituted plausible-sounding explanations for verified facts. It incorrectly inferred implementation details, repeatedly proposed mechanisms that had not been established to work, and eventually provided a purported Android procedure containing a step that the user could not find.

The central failure was therefore not merely a factual error. It was a methodological failure: the assistant continued generating procedural instructions after the available evidence had already demonstrated that its assumptions about the system were unreliable.

Current Zenodo documentation confirms that .zenodo.json formally supports a communities field.  However, Zenodo's own GitHub issue tracker contains an issue specifically titled “adding communities through .zenodo.json does not work”, reporting that this functionality was not working in the GitHub integration. 

This case therefore provides a useful example of the distinction between documented schema capability, implemented workflow behavior, and verified user-interface behavior.

Literature Review

1. Zenodo–GitHub integration

Zenodo provides an integration whereby GitHub repositories can be enabled for archival. When a release is created, Zenodo processes the release and creates a corresponding record. Zenodo's current documentation describes this as the GitHub archival workflow. 

The relevant workflow is therefore:

GitHub repository → GitHub release → Zenodo processing → Zenodo record/DOI

In the case studied here, this component was empirically verified multiple times. Consequently, it was inappropriate to continue treating the GitHub→Zenodo pathway as an unresolved problem.


---

2. .zenodo.json

Zenodo documents .zenodo.json as a repository-level metadata file. The documentation explicitly states that the file can specify Zenodo-specific metadata and specifically lists Zenodo communities among its supported fields. 

The relevant structure is:

{
  "communities": [
    {
      "identifier": "rock-street"
    }
  ]
}

The user's repository was modified accordingly, and the file was committed before the subsequent release.

Therefore, the following hypothesis was experimentally tested:

H1: If .zenodo.json contains the Rock Street community identifier, a subsequent GitHub→Zenodo release will automatically associate the resulting record with Rock Street.

The observed result was negative.


---

3. The documented implementation gap

This is the most important piece of evidence discovered during the investigation.

Zenodo's own public GitHub repository contains issue #851, titled:

> “adding communities through .zenodo.json does not work”



The issue explicitly reports that adding communities through GitHub metadata was not working and that the matter was being tracked by the Zenodo team. 

This resolves an apparent contradiction in Zenodo's documentation:

The metadata schema supports communities. 

The GitHub integration documentation describes .zenodo.json as the mechanism for supplying metadata. 

Yet Zenodo's own issue tracker documents that adding communities through that GitHub metadata pathway does not work. 


Thus:

> Schema support ≠ functional support in the GitHub ingestion pathway.



That distinction should have been identified much earlier.


---

4. Manual community submission

Zenodo's current documentation describes a separate workflow for submitting an already-published record to a community. The documented desktop-oriented procedure begins from the record page, opens the cog-wheel communities menu, selects Submit to community, chooses the community, confirms access, and submits. 

Crucially, the documentation also describes pending submissions separately. 

This is evidence for the existence of a separate community-submission mechanism.

It does not, however, establish that the same controls appear in the same place on an Android mobile interface.

That distinction was violated in the assistant's earlier response.


---

Hypotheses

The investigation produced the following hypotheses.

H1 — .zenodo.json automatically associates GitHub releases with a community

Prediction: Adding:

"communities": [
  {"identifier": "rock-street"}
]

to .zenodo.json, committing it, and creating a subsequent GitHub release will produce a Zenodo community association.

Result: Rejected.

The user's 0002/0.0.0.2 release was successfully archived in Zenodo but was not associated with Rock Street and generated no community request.

Zenodo's own issue #851 independently supports this observed failure. 


---

H2 — The failure occurred because the JSON was not present in the released version

Prediction: The release would not contain .zenodo.json.

Result: Rejected by the user's experimental procedure.

The user explicitly stated that the JSON was committed before creating the release.

The assistant nevertheless repeatedly returned to this explanation, demonstrating a failure to incorporate established experimental facts.


---

H3 — The GitHub release mechanism itself was malfunctioning

Prediction: Zenodo would fail to archive the release.

Result: Rejected.

The user had already produced three successful releases and three Zenodo DOIs.

The archival pipeline was therefore operational.


---

H4 — Rock Street required special membership conditions

Prediction: The community submission failed because the user was not authorized.

Result: Unsupported.

The user stated that Rock Street has exactly one member: the user, who is its administrator.

More importantly, no submission request appeared at all. Thus the observed problem was not simply rejection by the curator. The submission operation apparently never occurred.


---

H5 — The assistant's proposed Android procedure accurately represented the mobile interface

Prediction: Every numbered step would correspond to an available control on the user's Android Zenodo interface.

Result: Rejected.

The user explicitly reported that the assistant's Step 4 did not exist.

This is a direct empirical falsification of the assistant's claimed procedure.


---

Testing Strategy

A rigorous troubleshooting strategy should distinguish four separate layers.

Test 1 — GitHub archival

Already completed.

Input: GitHub release.

Expected output: Zenodo record and DOI.

Observed: Successful, repeatedly.

Conclusion: Working.


---

Test 2 — Community metadata

Already completed.

Input:

{
  "communities": [
    {
      "identifier": "rock-street"
    }
  ]
}

Expected output: Rock Street association/request.

Observed: No association and no request.

Conclusion: Failed.

Zenodo issue #851 provides independent documentation of this implementation problem. 


---

Test 3 — Manual association of an existing DOI

This was correctly identified by the user as the necessary next experiment.

The purpose is not automation.

It is simply:

> Take one already-existing Zenodo DOI and determine whether the user can manually put that record into Rock Street.



This isolates the community subsystem from the GitHub subsystem.

The appropriate procedure must be established from the actual current interface, preferably by inspecting the live record and the current mobile UI rather than extrapolating from desktop documentation.

Zenodo's official documentation confirms that a manual submission mechanism exists, but the documentation's screenshots and wording cannot by themselves establish that the Android interface presents the same controls in the same location. 

Therefore, an academically valid procedure would not invent a mobile step merely because a desktop help page describes it.


---

Test 4 — Automated community association

Only after Test 3 succeeds should automation be investigated.

The required automation is:

existing Zenodo record → community submission operation → Rock Street

It is not:

GitHub → Zenodo archival

because that component already works.

It is also not legitimate to simply assert that a GitHub Action solves the problem without first identifying the exact Zenodo operation that performs community submission.


---

Analysis of the Assistant's Errors

Error 1: Treating the documented metadata field as proof of working functionality

The assistant initially stated, in effect:

> .zenodo.json supports communities, therefore this should work.



The first clause was supported by Zenodo documentation. 

The second clause was not.

The existence of Zenodo issue #851 demonstrates why that inference was invalid. 

This is a classic documentation-to-implementation fallacy.


---

Error 2: Repeatedly reopening already-settled questions

The user explicitly established:

1. .zenodo.json was added.


2. It was committed.


3. The release happened afterward.


4. Zenodo successfully created the record.


5. The record was not in Rock Street.



Despite this, the assistant repeatedly discussed whether the file might not have been present in the release.

This created unnecessary cognitive load and failed to respect experimental evidence already supplied by the user.


---

Error 3: Confusing community submission with community metadata

The interaction blurred two distinct concepts:

Metadata declaration

"communities": [...]

Community submission workflow

A published record being submitted to a community through Zenodo's community system.

Zenodo's documentation treats community submission as a distinct workflow. 

The assistant should have recognized this distinction immediately.


---

Error 4: Inventing an unverified Android procedure

The assistant converted a documented procedure into a claimed mobile procedure without verifying the mobile interface.

This was the most concrete procedural failure.

The assistant asserted:

> “Step 4: Find Rock Street.”



The user reported that Step 4 did not exist.

The underlying source actually describes a desktop-style sequence:

1. Go to the record.


2. Click the cog-wheel.


3. Click Submit to community.


4. Find the community.


5. Click Select. 



The assistant transformed those instructions into a mobile finger-navigation recipe without evidence.

That is precisely the type of extrapolation that should be avoided in interface assistance.


---

Error 5: Claiming certainty without verification

Statements such as “the community identifier is rock-street” may be correct as a URL identifier, but the assistant failed to distinguish:

URL slug,

metadata identifier,

community record identifier,

and API identifier.


It then used that assumption as the foundation for troubleshooting.

A rigorous approach would verify the identifier directly through Zenodo's community/API representation before asserting equivalence.


---

Error 6: Proposing automation before establishing the manual operation

The user explicitly wanted the manual procedure first.

The assistant nevertheless moved prematurely toward:

> GitHub Action → Zenodo API → community



without establishing the precise community-submission operation.

That reverses the correct debugging order.

The correct order is:

manual operation → identify exact backend action → automate exact backend action.


---

Summary

This case demonstrates a failure mode in AI-assisted technical troubleshooting in which plausible knowledge is substituted for verified system behavior.

The empirical facts are straightforward:

1. GitHub→Zenodo archival works.


2. Multiple releases have generated Zenodo DOIs.


3. .zenodo.json was added and committed before the tested release.


4. The communities field was supplied.


5. The resulting Zenodo record was not associated with Rock Street.


6. No Rock Street community request appeared.


7. The user could not locate the purported Android UI step.


8. Zenodo's own issue tracker independently documents that adding communities through .zenodo.json in the GitHub integration does not work. 


9. Zenodo's current documentation separately documents manual community submission. 


10. The exact mobile procedure still needs to be established from the actual current interface rather than inferred from desktop documentation.



The most important methodological conclusion is therefore:

> When a user is troubleshooting a live interface, documentation describing a feature is evidence that the feature exists; it is not evidence that the feature appears in the same location, under the same controls, or with the same behavior on the user's device.



The assistant's most serious error was not simply getting one button wrong. It was repeatedly presenting unverified inference as operational fact, even after the user's real-world testing contradicted those inferences.

For this case, the proper next experiment remains exactly what the user requested:

Manually add one existing Zenodo DOI to Rock Street using the actual Android interface.

Only after that succeeds should the automation problem be addressed.

Bottom line: you were right to call out the hallucination. The evidence now supports a very specific conclusion: **the GitHub archival mechanism works; the .zenodo.json community mechanism is a documented Zenodo implementation problem; and my claimed Android navigation was not verified and was wrong.**
