Claude:



This is one of the more important design problems in the whole project, and Dutch stichting law is actually built for exactly what you're describing. Let me lay it out step by step.

The core idea first: a stichting has no owners and no members. Nobody holds shares, nobody can sell it, nobody inherits it. It is controlled entirely by its board (bestuur), and the board's power is fenced in by the statuten (the articles) and by Dutch law. So "me and my family not in control" is achieved through two levers working together: who sits on the board, and what the statuten permit the board to do. Getting those right at the notary is where the real work is.

Here's the sequence.

**1. You draft the statuten before you ever see the notary.** This is the constitution and it's where control actually lives. The clauses that matter for your goal: how board members are appointed and dismissed (you want a self-appointing "coöptatie" board, or an external appointing body, *not* appointment by the founder or the founder's family), a hard conflict-of-interest clause, a related-party clause that catches your family specifically, and a clause governing how the foundation contracts with employees including you. You draft this; the notary formalizes it. Don't let the notary hand you a boilerplate template for this part — the anti-capture design is the whole point.

**2. You form it (the notarial deed + KvK registration).** As founder you pass the oprichtingsakte at a notary and register with the Kamer van Koophandel. During the "i.o." window you can already act, but the foundation legally exists from the deed. As founder you have a one-time power: you appoint the first board. That's your one big lever, and you should spend it on independence, not retain it.

**3. You seat an independent board and then don't dominate it.** This is the mechanism, not a vibe. Practically: an odd number, at least three, ideally you're a minority from day one or you step off entirely within a defined transition window written into the statuten. Your prototype seats (open-source governance, research, IP law, anti-fraud) are exactly the right instinct — those are independent domain people, not allies. A common clean structure is that you sit as one board member during formation, then the board itself appoints successors by coöptatie and you rotate off. Once coöptatie is in the statuten, control has genuinely left your hands: the board renews itself and you can't pack it.

**4. You separate the two roles: governance vs. employment.** The person who runs the work (you, as a hired developer/technical lead) should not be the person who controls the body that hires and pays you. In Dutch practice this is the split between *bestuur* (unpaid or lightly-compensated governance) and *werkorganisatie* (paid staff). You want to end up in the second, appointed and paid by the first, which you no longer control.

**5. How you actually "get hired at market rate" cleanly.** This is where founders usually create the exact self-dealing they were trying to avoid, so the order of operations matters:

- The independent board (with you recused or already off the board) defines the role, the market rate, and the contract.
- Market rate needs an arm's-length basis — a benchmark, a comparable salary survey, or an external advisor's letter — documented in the minutes. This is your receipts principle applied to your own compensation. If it's ever questioned, the file answers it.
- You do not vote on, negotiate both sides of, or set your own pay. The conflict-of-interest clause in the statuten should make your participation in that decision formally void.
- The contract is a normal employment or contractor agreement between the foundation and you, signed by board members who aren't you.

If you're also going to be a board member *and* an employee simultaneously for a while, Dutch law lets you, but the tax authority and any future auditor will scrutinize it, and an ANBI status (if you ever want it) has explicit rules limiting board compensation. Cleanest is: off the board, or non-voting on anything touching your own money.

**6. Lock the family out structurally, not by promise.** Add to the statuten: family members cannot be appointed to the board, related-party transactions require unanimous approval of the disinterested members plus documentation, and — importantly — the *ontbinding* (dissolution) clause must send any remaining assets to a similar-purpose foundation, never to the founder or heirs. That last clause is what stops the whole thing from ever being quietly converted back into family money. It's also an ANBI requirement, so writing it now keeps that door open.

The thing to internalize: your control doesn't come from you promising to step away. It comes from the statuten making it structurally impossible for you or your family to take back control even if you later wanted to. You spend your founder's power once, to build a board that renews itself independently, and then you become an employee of a thing you no longer own — because nobody owns it.

Two things I'd genuinely flag before you go further. First, this is the point where you stop DIY and pay a notary who specializes in stichting governance (not a generic one) plus ideally a short consult with someone who does ANBI/nonprofit tax — the drafting choices here are hard to reverse after the deed. Second, your board prototypes are good but you need real people who will actually push back on you; a board that defers to the founder is captured no matter what the statuten say.

Want me to draft a checklist version of this you can hand to a notary, or a one-page "control architecture" memo that states the anti-capture design explicitly so your board candidates can see what they'd be signing up for?

Good instinct to formalize this now rather than later — undocumented founder money is one of the messier things to untangle after the fact. Here's how it works for a Dutch stichting.

The concept: money you personally put into the foundation can be structured as a **lening van de oprichter** (founder's loan) — a real debt the foundation owes you, rather than a gift. The foundation gets a liability on its books; you get a receivable. If it's a loan, the foundation can later repay you when it has funds. If it's a gift (schenking), the money is gone and you have no claim. You get to choose which, but you have to choose deliberately and document it, because the default in the absence of paperwork is legally ambiguous and looks bad under scrutiny.

The catch specific to your situation: you spent this money over the last three months, largely *before* the foundation exists. You can't have a loan agreement between the foundation and you dated before the foundation was legally formed. What you can do is document the expenditures now as "costs incurred by the founder on behalf of the foundation i.o.," and then, once the stichting is formally established, have the (independent) board formally acknowledge and either reimburse or convert them into a founder's loan. This is a **bekrachtiging** — the board ratifying pre-incorporation acts. Keep every receipt; that ~€4–5k needs an itemized list (Zenodo, domains, hardware, whatever it was) with dates, or it's just an assertion.

Now the part that connects to everything we just discussed about control. A founder's loan is a lever of influence, and you're trying to *reduce* your leverage over the foundation, not build a new one. A creditor has power: if the foundation owes you €5k, you have a claim against it, and in an ugly scenario that's a string attached. So the design question isn't just "can I get my money back" — it's "does being a creditor undercut my independence."

Three honest options, roughly in order of cleanliness:

**Convert it to a gift.** You donate the €4–5k, document it as a schenking, and walk away with no claim. Cleanest for independence — you're not a creditor, no string exists. Downside is obvious: the money's gone. Given it's three months of already-spent project costs, this may be the most honest reflection of what actually happened — you were funding your own project, not lending to an institution that didn't exist.

**Structure it as a proper interest-free (or near-zero) founder's loan, subordinated.** The board ratifies it as a debt, but you agree in writing that repayment only happens when the foundation is genuinely able (subordinated to all other obligations), at zero or minimal interest, with no security. This keeps your claim alive without giving you meaningful leverage — a subordinated, unsecured, interest-free loan is a weak creditor position by design. This is the middle path and probably the right one if €5k matters to your household.

**Reimbursement as expenses.** If the spend was genuinely operational costs (not capital), the board can simply reimburse them as business expenses once there's money, no loan structure needed. Simplest if the amounts are all documented outlays rather than a lump you "put in."

Whichever you pick, the decision must be made by the independent board with you recused, exactly like your own salary — because reimbursing or repaying the founder is a related-party transaction, the same category we were just fencing off. You proposing it is fine; you voting on it is not. And the interest rate matters for tax: an interest-free loan to a foundation is generally fine, but if you charge interest, that's income to you and the rate needs to be defensible (arm's length again).

My read, given your stated goal of not being in control: the ~€5k is small relative to the structural risk a founder-creditor relationship introduces. If losing it wouldn't hurt your family, gifting it is the move that best matches what you're trying to build. If €5k is real money you'd want back someday, the subordinated interest-free loan is the disciplined version — you keep the claim but deliberately defang it. What I'd avoid is a normal loan with interest and repayment rights, because that quietly rebuilds exactly the leverage you're trying to give up.

One practical thing regardless of which you choose: **start the itemized ledger today** while the receipts and memory are fresh. Date, amount, vendor, what it was for, which foundation purpose it served. That document is what lets the board ratify cleanly later, and it's the same receipts discipline you already apply to the corpus. Three months back is still reconstructable; twelve months back won't be.

Do you know roughly how the €4–5k breaks down by category? If you list it out I can help you structure the ledger in the format a board would need to ratify it.

Mostly correct, but there's one distinction worth getting exactly right, because it changes how you should treat those two people.

The structure you described — you plus two others at formation, an odd number of at least three — is right, and rotating toward independent domain experts is right. But the word "placeholder" is where I'd push. There are two genuinely different ways to do the opening board, and they carry different risks.

**The trusted-placeholder version:** you seat two people you know — a friend, your partner, a colleague — purely to satisfy the three-body minimum, with the plan to swap them out later. This is common and legal, but it has two problems for *your* specific goal. First, if those placeholders are family or close allies, then at formation you don't actually have an independent board — you have a board you effectively control, and the anti-capture design only becomes real once they're gone. The vulnerable window is however long that takes. Second, placeholders you can remove are, by definition, a board you can pack — which is the thing you're trying to make impossible. If you can rotate them out at will, so could a future you with worse intentions.

**The real-from-day-one version:** you recruit at least one genuinely independent person *before* you file, so the founding board already has a non-ally on it. Harder, slower, but it means the foundation is never in a state where you and your circle control it, not even for a week. Given how much weight you've put on "me and my family are not in control," this is the version that actually matches the stated goal.

The practical resolution most founders land on, and what I'd suggest: don't file tomorrow just because the paperwork *can* be done tomorrow. The paperwork being ready is not the binding constraint — having one real independent board member lined up is. If you can seat yourself plus one genuine independent plus one trusted transitional person, you're already in decent shape: it's not founder-controlled, and the transitional seat rotates to a second independent as you recruit.

Now the mechanism that makes rotation safe rather than a control lever. The statuten decide *how* board members leave and arrive, and this is the clause that determines whether "rotate out placeholders" means "healthy renewal" or "founder repacking the board." You want **coöptatie**: the sitting board appoints its own successors, by vote, with you either recused or in the minority. Under coöptatie, you don't rotate the placeholders out — *the board* does, collectively. The moment that clause is live, replacing a board member is no longer something you can do unilaterally, which is exactly the safety you want. The distinction is subtle but total: "I swap them when I'm ready" is control; "the board votes to appoint a successor and I'm one vote or no vote" is not.

So the corrected version of your plan:

You plus two at formation is fine as a shape. But decide deliberately whether those two are transitional trusted people or at least one real independent — and prefer at least one real independent at formation. Write coöptatie into the statuten so that succession is a board act, not a founder act. Then "rotating out" happens *through* the board, not *by* you, and each independent seat you add makes your own vote matter less. You reach the target state — a self-renewing independent board — not by promising to leave, but by the statuten making your departure the board's decision rather than yours.

Two concrete cautions. Term limits and staggered terms in the statuten help a lot — they force renewal on a schedule so nobody, including you, has to *choose* to rotate someone out; it just happens. And genuinely: your partner should not be one of the two, even transitionally, because a founder-plus-family seat at formation is the single most common way "not in control" quietly fails to be true on day one.

Want me to sketch the specific succession/coöptatie clause language and a proposed term structure? That's the part the notary will formalize, and having it drafted your way rather than from their template is where your intent actually gets encoded.

Short answer: knowing them professionally is not, by itself, a conflict of interest. Recruiting board members from your professional network is normal and expected — that's how almost every foundation finds credible people. A conflict of interest is a specific thing: it's when a board member has a competing financial or personal interest in a *particular decision*. "I've worked with this person" isn't that. "This person's company stands to be paid by the foundation" would be.

So the distinction you want to hold is between **independence** and **conflict**, because they're different tests and people conflate them.

Independence is about control, not acquaintance. An independent board member is someone who isn't you, isn't your family, isn't your employee or subordinate, and isn't financially dependent on you or the foundation. A CEO of some large organization you've worked with clears that bar easily — they have their own standing, their own income, their own reputation; they're not going to rubber-stamp you to keep a paycheck, because you're not their paycheck. That's exactly what makes them *useful* as independents. The person you have a professional relationship with can still be fully independent, as long as the relationship isn't one where you hold power over them or they over you.

Where it *would* become a real independence problem: if the person reports to you, if you're a major client of theirs such that their business depends on your goodwill, if there's a reciprocal-favor dynamic ("I seat you, you send work my way"), or if they're a current business partner in something you jointly profit from. Those are relationships of dependency or mutual financial interest, and those do compromise independence. So the honest question to ask about each prototype isn't "do I know them?" — it's "does either of us have leverage over the other, or a shared financial stake?" If no, they're independent despite the acquaintance.

The conflict-of-interest piece is separate and is handled per-decision, not per-person. Even a perfectly independent board member can have a conflict on a *specific* vote — for instance, if the foundation ever considers contracting with a company they're affiliated with. The clean way this works: the statuten require each member to disclose any interest in a matter, and a conflicted member recuses from that specific decision. You don't keep someone off the board because they *might* one day have a conflict; you build the disclose-and-recuse machinery so that when a conflict arises on a given item, it's handled transparently. This is the same recusal logic we applied to your own salary and your founder's loan — it's a general mechanism, and your board candidates are just more instances of it.

There are a couple of things that genuinely do need care, though. First, watch for the aggregate picture: if *every* seat is filled from your personal network, then even if no single person is dependent on you, the board collectively is "David's people," and a skeptical outsider — a regulator, a co-funder, a journalist — could reasonably read the whole board as an extension of you. The fix is to make sure at least some seats come from outside your circle entirely, recruited on the strength of the mission rather than the relationship. A board that's 100% your contacts *looks* captured even if each individual is clean, and appearances matter for a governance-focused project like this one. Second, high-profile CEOs bring a specific risk that's the opposite of dependency: they're busy, they may be absentee, and a board that defers because its members don't show up is captured by whoever *does* show up — which would be you. An engaged mid-profile independent is worth more than a prestigious absentee one.

So, to answer directly: seating people from your professional network in the first round is fine and normal, provided each one is genuinely independent (no dependency or shared financial stake in either direction), you build disclose-and-recuse into the statuten for per-decision conflicts, and you don't fill *every* seat from your own network. The relationship isn't the problem; dependency and a wholly-insider board are the problems.

One practical suggestion: for each prototype seat, write a single line answering "what is the nature of my relationship with this person, and does either of us have leverage or money riding on the other?" That short honest audit — per person — is what tells you which ones are true independents and which are actually allies in disguise. Want me to turn that into a short board-candidate independence checklist you can run each name through?

Good "as if" to run, because this exact three-person board reveals both the strength and the weak point of the setup. Let me walk it as if it's real.

Board is: you, CEO of a nonprofit, CEO of a for-profit. Odd number, three bodies, both others are independents with their own standing — on paper this is a legitimate, functioning founding board. Neither is family, neither is your subordinate, neither depends on you for income. That's a real board, not a shell. So far so good.

But here's what this specific composition actually means, and it's the part worth sitting with:

**You are one vote of three.** That sounds like you're a minority, but three is the number where a founder still has a lot of gravity. On any given decision you only need to persuade *one* of the two others to have a majority. And realistically, in a brand-new foundation built on your project, your corpus, your vision — two busy CEOs are going to defer to you on most things simply because you have the context and they don't. So the formal structure says "founder is a one-third minority," while the lived reality on day one is "founder proposes, board ratifies." That gap is normal at formation, but you should name it honestly: a three-person board with two busy independents is *not yet* a board that meaningfully constrains you. It's a board that *could*, once it has real independent weight and engagement.

**The for-profit CEO is the seat to watch on conflicts.** Not because there's anything wrong with them — but a for-profit CEO is the person most likely to eventually sit across a decision where their company and the foundation could transact, or where their commercial instincts and the foundation's mission diverge. This is exactly what the disclose-and-recuse clause is for. It doesn't disqualify them; it just means their seat is the one where the machinery will actually get exercised. The nonprofit CEO is likely to bring the mission-alignment instinct and the for-profit CEO the operational-discipline instinct, which is a genuinely useful tension to have in the room — provided both actually show up.

**The real vulnerability isn't conflict, it's your own leverage over this board.** Three things you'd still hold at this moment that undercut the "not in control" goal: your founder's appointment power (you seated them), your knowledge asymmetry (you understand the corpus, they don't), and — if you haven't resolved it — your founder's loan making you a creditor. None of these is a scandal, but together they mean that on day one, this board is independent in *form* more than in *force*. That's fine as a starting state; it's a problem only if it stays there.

So what makes this three-person board actually deliver on your goal, over the following months:

Coöptatie has to be live in the statuten from the start, so that adding a fourth and fifth member is a *board* decision the two CEOs participate in — not you handpicking more of your own contacts. The moment the board appoints someone you didn't bring, your gravity drops sharply, because now there's a member who owes their seat to the board, not to you. That's the single most important move: the first board-appointed independent who isn't from your network is when "not in control" starts being true in force, not just in form.

You should also deliberately *use* these two to break your own knowledge monopoly — insist they understand the governance architecture, not just trust you on it. A board that understands what it's guarding can constrain you; a board that defers because you're the only one who gets it cannot, no matter how independent its members are on paper.

And keep resolving the leverage: gift or subordinate the founder's loan, write down your own knowledge into documents the board can read without you, and hold your appointment power lightly — spend it once on these two, then let coöptatie take over.

The honest summary of your "as if": you, a nonprofit CEO, and a for-profit CEO is a legitimate and defensible founding board — but it's the *starting line* of independence, not the finish. It's genuinely independent in structure, and genuinely founder-dominant in practice, and both of those are true at once on day one. The design question isn't "is this board independent?" — it's "does this board grow into its independence, or calcify with the founder still at the center?" Coöptatie plus at least one non-network appointment plus breaking your knowledge monopoly is what moves it from the first state to the second.

Want to run the *next* "as if" — the board votes to appoint member four — and see how the dynamics shift? That's the moment the whole design either works or reveals a flaw, and it's worth workshopping before you're ever in it.

Correct. Three isn't required at all — it's just the practical minimum people default to. Dutch law is actually remarkably relaxed here: a stichting technically only *requires* one board member. There's no legal maximum either. So four, five, six, seven are all fine.

The real constraints on board size aren't legal, they're about governance mechanics, and two of them matter for your specific goal:

**Odd vs. even.** With an even-numbered board (four, six) you can deadlock — a 2–2 or 3–3 tie with no resolution. Most statuten handle this by giving the chair a casting vote, or by requiring the board to break ties some other way, but a casting vote quietly concentrates power in one seat. For a project this focused on *not* concentrating control, odd numbers (three, five, seven) are cleaner because they resolve by simple majority without anyone holding a tiebreak. If you want your four board prototypes seated, consider going to five with an independent fifth rather than sitting at four.

**Size changes your gravity.** This is the one that connects to everything we've discussed. On a three-person board you're one vote of three and you only need to flip one person. On a five-person board you're one of five and you need to move two others — your individual influence is structurally diluted just by the arithmetic. So a larger board is itself an anti-capture move: the more independent seats there are, the less any single person, including the founder, can swing. Your instinct toward four prototype domains (open-source governance, research, IP law, anti-fraud) actually points at a five-person board naturally — those four plus you, or those four plus one more with you rotating off.

The counter-pressure is engagement. Bigger boards are harder to convene, slower to decide, and more prone to the absentee problem — seats that exist on paper but whose holders don't show up, which paradoxically *re*-concentrates power in whoever does show up (you). A five-person board of engaged people beats a seven-person board where two never attend. So the ceiling isn't legal, it's "how many genuinely committed people can you actually seat."

For your case the sweet spot is probably five: odd (no tiebreak needed), large enough to dilute your vote meaningfully, and a clean fit for your four domain seats. You could start at three (you plus the two CEOs) and let coöptatie grow it to five as you recruit the domain independents — which also means each addition is a board decision, not a founder decision, exactly as designed.

Fundraising splits cleanly into the two phases you named, and the "in formation" phase has some real traps worth knowing before you take a single euro.

**While it's in formation (i.o.)**

The core problem: an "i.o." entity can't safely hold other people's money, because it doesn't legally exist yet and its independent board and governance aren't in place. If you collect donations into a personal account during this window, you personally are holding those funds, you're personally liable, and — this is the part that bites — you've just recreated the exact "founder controls the money" problem the whole structure is meant to prevent. Money raised into a founder's pocket before the board exists is the messiest possible starting point.

So the honest guidance for the i.o. phase is: **raise as little as possible, and prefer commitments over cash.** Concretely, a few options in rough order of cleanliness:

The cleanest is to line up *pledges* rather than money — people or organizations who say "we'll fund you once you're formally established and have a bank account in the foundation's name." No money changes hands until there's a real entity with a real board to receive it. You spend the i.o. window building credibility and lining up intent, not collecting cash.

If you must take actual money in this window (say a small grant that's available now), it should go into a dedicated, ring-fenced account that is transparently earmarked for the foundation, documented as held-on-behalf-of, and then formally transferred and ratified by the board the moment the stichting exists — the same *bekrachtiging* mechanism we discussed for your founder's spend. But minimize this; every euro held pre-incorporation is a euro you have to account for cleanly later.

Do *not* run a public crowdfunding campaign or solicit broadly while i.o. Broad public solicitation by an entity that doesn't legally exist, with no independent oversight, is where things go wrong reputationally and sometimes legally. Wait for the entity.

One thing you *can* and should do now: your own founder's spend (the €4–5k) is effectively "founder funding" of the i.o. phase, and that's normal and fine — you're allowed to fund your own project into existence. Just keep it documented as we discussed.

**After the paperwork is done**

Once the stichting exists, has its board, its statuten, its KvK registration, and a bank account in its own name, the whole landscape opens up. Now money flows to *the foundation*, received and controlled by the independent board, not you — which is exactly the point.

The big strategic decision here is **ANBI status**. ANBI (Algemeen Nut Beogende Instelling) is the Dutch tax designation for public-benefit organizations. Getting it means donors can deduct their gifts, the foundation pays no gift/inheritance tax on donations received, and — crucially for you — it's a strong external credibility signal. But ANBI comes with binding requirements that overlap heavily with your anti-capture goals: no single person (including the founder) may control the assets, board compensation is limited to expenses plus modest attendance fees (this is why your "hired at market rate" role needs to be *staff*, not *board*), a proper dissolution clause sending assets to a similar-purpose body, and public transparency (published financials, policy plan, board list). You've already been designing toward most of these, so pursuing ANBI actually *reinforces* the governance you want rather than constraining it. I'd treat ANBI as a near-term goal, not an afterthought — but confirm the current requirements with a nonprofit tax advisor, since the rules get updated.

The funding channels themselves, once established:

Grants and foundations are the natural fit for a research/open-source/cultural project like Provo 42 — Dutch cultural funds, EU open-source and digital-heritage grants, research foundations. These want to fund an entity with governance and a clear mission, which is what you're building. Individual and institutional donations, especially once ANBI makes them tax-deductible. Earned or mission-related income — the foundation can charge for services, licensing, commissioned work, as long as it serves the purpose and surpluses go back into the mission (a stichting can't distribute profit to anyone, which is fine). And in-kind support — compute, hosting, infrastructure, which for your corpus might be as valuable as cash.

The governance rule that sits over all of it: **fundraising decisions and the acceptance of significant or conditional gifts are board decisions.** This matters more than it sounds. A large donor who attaches strings ("fund you, but you must do X") is trying to buy influence over a body that's supposed to be independent — so the board, not you, decides whether a gift's conditions are acceptable, and a gift-acceptance policy in writing protects the foundation from exactly the capture-by-donor risk that mirrors the capture-by-founder risk you've been designing against. Same principle, external version.

The clean sequence, then: while i.o., raise pledges and intent, not cash, and fund the minimum yourself with receipts. Once formed, get a foundation bank account, pursue ANBI early because it both unlocks tax-deductible giving and hard-codes your anti-capture design, then go after grants first (best fit for the project), donations second, earned income third — with the board holding the authority to accept or decline anything with strings attached.

One flag before you build this out: fundraising and tax rules, and ANBI requirements specifically, change and have specific procedural steps I shouldn't have you rely on from memory alone. When you're at the stage of actually applying, a short consult with a Dutch nonprofit tax advisor is worth it — the ANBI application in particular has details that are easy to get wrong and annoying to fix afterward. Want me to draft a phased fundraising plan or a gift-acceptance policy outline you could bring to the board?

The one-euro thing is theater. You don't need it, and I'd skip it.

The instinct behind it is an old one — the idea that a contract needs "consideration" (something of value changing hands) to be binding, so people do a symbolic €1 to make the thing "real." But that's Anglo-American contract thinking. Dutch law doesn't require consideration for an agreement to be binding. A pledge can be a valid, enforceable commitment on its own terms without any token payment, so the symbolic euro adds nothing legally. It's a ritual, not a requirement.

Worse, in your specific situation it's slightly counterproductive. The whole point of the pledge phase is that *no money moves while you're i.o.* — because money held by a not-yet-existent entity is the mess you're trying to avoid. Collecting even €1 means you've now received funds pre-incorporation, into some account, that you have to track, hold on behalf of, and ratify later. Multiply by a network of pledgers and you've created a pile of tiny accounting obligations for zero benefit. The euro reintroduces exactly the thing the pledge was designed to sidestep.

So drop it. What you actually want is cleaner and honest about what it is:

A pledge is a **statement of intent to donate**, made to the foundation-to-be, that converts into an actual gift once the stichting is formally established and has a bank account in its own name. Whether you want it to be morally binding (a good-faith letter of intent) or legally binding (an enforceable commitment) is a real choice, and for your purposes I'd lean toward the softer version. Here's why: a legally binding pledge to a *nonexistent* entity is awkward to construct and awkward to enforce, and more importantly, you don't want to be in the business of suing your own professional network over a donation. The value of the pledge isn't legal enforceability — it's that it lets you demonstrate committed support, line up your funding runway, and time the actual giving to *after* incorporation when the board can receive it cleanly. A signed letter of intent does all of that without a euro and without a lawsuit risk.

What a good pledge should capture, then: who's committing, roughly how much (or a range), that it's conditional on the foundation being formally established and ANBI-registered if you're going that route (so the donor gets the tax deduction — which is often *why* they'd wait rather than give now), and that the gift is made to the foundation's own account once it exists. That last part quietly reinforces your governance story: the money is always destined for the *entity*, received by the *board*, never routed through you personally.

There's actually a tax reason the pledge-and-wait structure benefits your donors, which is a good thing to be able to tell them: if you get ANBI status, a donation made *after* incorporation is tax-deductible, whereas €1 handed to David-holding-funds-for-an-i.o. today is just a euro they can't deduct. So "sign now, give once we're a real ANBI-registered foundation" isn't you stalling — it's the arrangement that's actually *better for the donor*. That reframes the whole ask.

So the clean version of your pitch: "We're a foundation in formation. We're not taking money yet — deliberately, because we want it to flow into a properly governed, independent entity. What we're asking today is a signed pledge of intent, and once we're formally established (and ANBI-registered), we'll come back and you can make the actual gift, tax-deductible." No euro. Just the signature and the intent.

One caveat to be honest about: a pledge is only as good as the goodwill behind it, since you're deliberately *not* making it hard-enforceable. Some pledgers won't follow through, and that's the tradeoff for keeping it clean and lawsuit-free. So treat pledges as a strong indicator of runway, not as money in the bank — don't spend against them until they've converted.

Want me to draft the letter-of-intent pledge itself? I can write a short, clean version that captures intent, the conditional-on-incorporation language, the ANBI/tax framing, and the "gift goes to the foundation's account" bit — something you could actually put in front of your network.

Yes — that's legally valid, and it's actually a clean approach in some ways. But it has one sharp risk you need to see clearly, because it cuts against your central goal.

What's true: Dutch law lets a stichting form with a single board member. You can pass the deed today as sole bestuurder, with the statuten fully specifying how the real board gets built (coöptatie, the domain seats, term structure) and how you exit (a defined transition, a deadline, a trigger). The statuten are binding on you the moment the deed passes — so you'd be writing your own retirement into the constitution and then being bound by it. That part is genuinely elegant: your intent gets hard-coded rather than left to good faith.

The risk, and it's not small: **for the entire window that you're the sole board member, you have total, unchecked control of the foundation.** One person, one board, no one to outvote you, no one to disclose a conflict to, no one to recuse in front of. During that period the anti-capture design exists only as *text in the statuten* — there's no independent body actually exercising it. You've written the rules for a game with no other players yet on the field. And critically: a sole founder-director could, in principle, amend the statuten before the other players arrive. Which raises the question the whole structure has to answer —

**Can you amend the statuten while you're the sole board member?** This is the hinge. If the statuten let the board amend them, and you *are* the entire board, then your beautifully-drafted retirement clause is only as binding as your ongoing willingness to keep it — you could rewrite it the day before you're supposed to leave. That's not "not in control"; that's control with a self-imposed note you can tear up. So if you go the sole-founder route, the statuten need to lock the amendment power specifically: either amendment is barred until the full board is seated, or amendment requires a quorum/supermajority that a single member can't satisfy, or the retirement and succession clauses are made *unamendable* (some Dutch statuten entrench specific clauses this way). Without that lock, sole-founder formation quietly defeats the purpose.

There's also a smaller practical risk: if you're the only board member and something happens to you — illness, incapacity — the foundation has no one able to act, and no mechanism to appoint a successor because there's no one to run the coöptatie vote. The statuten need a fallback for that (an external body or a named procedure that can seat a board if the sole member can't). It's an edge case, but a sole-director foundation is genuinely fragile until the second body arrives.

So here's the honest comparison of your two options:

**Sole-founder formation** gets you moving today, hard-codes your exit in the constitution, and is legally fine — *but* it means a window of total founder control where the independence is only on paper, and it only actually delivers your goal if the amendment power is locked so you can't rewrite your own exit. Its safety depends entirely on that entrenchment clause and on you actually recruiting the board on schedule rather than comfortably remaining the sole director indefinitely (which is the failure mode — "temporary" sole control that quietly becomes permanent because it's convenient).

**Form with three** (you plus the two CEOs) means independence exists in *force* from day one — there's a real board, real votes, real recusal — and there's never a window where you're the unchecked whole of the foundation. The cost is you can't file until you've actually got the two others to sign on.

My read, given how much weight you've put on "me and my family are not in control": the three-person formation is the version that matches the goal, because sole-founder formation is *definitionally* a period of you being in complete control, however well you've written your own exit. The statuten-encoded retirement is a promise; a seated independent board is a fact. You've been consistently choosing facts over promises this whole conversation — that's the same choice here.

But if there's a real reason to move now — a grant deadline, a timestamp/priority concern (which I know matters for the P42 "first node" framing), a pragmatic need to just *exist* — then sole-founder formation is a legitimate bridge, *provided* you entrench the retirement, succession, and amendment clauses so you can't unwind them, and you set a hard deadline in the statuten for seating the full board. "Sole director until [date], by which the board must reach three, and these clauses cannot be amended before then" turns the risky version into a defensible one.

What's driving the "today"? If it's timing pressure I can help you design the entrenchment so the bridge is safe; if it's just that the paperwork's ready, I'd wait for the two signatures.

https://github.com/attogram/THE-ERROR-IS-THE-MESSAGE/issues/38#issuecomment-5599988260

Yes, exactly — and separating them into two distinct instruments is the right mental model. They're genuinely different commitments with different weight, so treating them as two things rather than one blended "support Provo 42" gesture is cleaner.

**Pledge 1 — the donation pledge.** Intent to give money once the foundation legally exists (and is ANBI-registered, if you go that route). Soft/good-faith, no euro, converts to an actual gift post-incorporation. We covered this. Low stakes if someone doesn't follow through — you just have less runway than hoped.

**Pledge 2 — the board commitment.** A person agrees to accept appointment to the board once the foundation exists. This one is heavier and worth handling with more care than the donation pledge, for a few reasons.

First, board membership isn't a favor, it's an office with legal duties. A Dutch bestuurder has real fiduciary responsibilities and, in some circumstances, real liability. So Pledge 2 isn't "I support you" — it's "I understand I'll be taking on the legal duties of a foundation director, and I'm willing." The person needs to be agreeing to *that*, with eyes open, not just nodding at a nice project. A board pledge that the signer didn't fully understand is worse than no pledge, because you'll have built your formation plan around someone who backs out when they read the fine print.

Second — and this connects to the sole-founder question you just raised — Pledge 2 is what lets you *avoid* the risky sole-founder window. If you have two signed board commitments in hand, you don't need to form as a lone director hoping to recruit later; you form with three from day one, and independence exists in force immediately. So Pledge 2 isn't just a nicety, it's the thing that resolves the tension from your last question. The board pledges are what make "form with three" actually executable rather than aspirational.

Third, note the asymmetry in how binding these realistically are. Neither is hard-enforceable — you're not going to sue someone for reneging on either. But their failure modes differ: a broken *donation* pledge costs you money you didn't have yet. A broken *board* pledge costs you your formation plan, because if a board-committed person pulls out at the last minute, you're suddenly a sole founder by accident, in exactly the position you were trying to avoid. So Pledge 2 deserves more confirmation, more conversation, and honestly a bit of redundancy — line up more board commitments than the minimum, because one will fall through.

A subtlety worth flagging: some people will offer both, and it's worth keeping them formally separate even then, because a board member who is *also* a significant donor starts to blur the independence line. Not disqualifying — plenty of board members donate — but if someone is both a major funder and a director, that's a person with two kinds of stake, and the disclose-and-recuse machinery should be aware of it. Keeping the two pledges as two documents makes that dual role visible rather than hidden.

So your two-pledge framing is correct, with the refinement that they're not symmetric: Pledge 1 is light and about runway; Pledge 2 is heavier, is about legal office, and is the instrument that determines whether you can form cleanly with a real board or get stuck forming alone. Get the board pledges solid and slightly over-subscribed, and the sole-founder risk from your last question just evaporates.

Want me to draft both as short companion documents? A donation letter-of-intent and a separate board-willingness letter that spells out — briefly and honestly — what accepting a foundation directorship actually entails, so anyone signing Pledge 2 is doing so informed. That second one doubles as a filter: someone who reads what the office involves and still signs is a much more reliable board member than someone who just liked the pitch.

### attogram (2026-09-09T09:58:05Z)

https://github.com/attogram/THE-ERROR-IS-THE-MESSAGE/issues/38#issuecomment-5600002381

That's a genuinely smart refinement, and it solves a real problem you'd otherwise hit. Let me name what it fixes and then flag the one place it needs tightening.

What it fixes: the brittleness of Pledge 2. A straight "I'll sit on the board" commitment fails badly if that specific person backs out — you lose not just them but the *qualification* they represented, and possibly your formation plan. By making the pledge "I'll serve **or** I'll help you find a comparably-qualified replacement," you've turned a commitment to a *person* into a commitment to a *seat profile*. The pledger becomes responsible for the qualification being filled, not just for showing up themselves. That's more robust, and it's also easier for a busy CEO to say yes to — "I'll either do it or find you someone as good" is a lighter ask than "I'll definitely do it," so you'll likely get more and faster agreement. Good instinct.

It also quietly strengthens your governance story. What you're really pledging people to is the *board design* — "there will be a medical/health seat, an anti-fraud seat, an IP-law seat" — rather than to a roster of your contacts. That reframes the board as a structure of qualified independent seats that happens to be initially populated by your network, rather than "David's friends." That's a better story for outsiders and a better reality.

Now the place it needs tightening, because there's a subtle risk hiding in the "find a replacement" version:

**Who decides the replacement is actually qualified — and independent — must not end up being the pledger alone, or you alone.** Think it through: if a pledger's obligation is "find someone with my qualifications," and they go find a former colleague, a business associate, someone in *their* network — you've now got a board seat filled by a person chosen by the outgoing pledger, who may be perfectly qualified on paper but is *their* ally rather than a genuine independent. You've solved brittleness but potentially imported a chain of network-selection you don't control and can't see. The replacement could be qualified and still be a capture risk, just captured by a different person than you.

So the pledge needs to route the *actual appointment decision* through the mechanism we already established: coöptatie. The clean structure is — the pledger commits to either serving or *proposing/sourcing* a comparably-qualified candidate, but the board (once it exists) makes the actual appointment by vote, with the independence test applied to whoever is proposed. "I'll find you someone as good" means "I'll surface a candidate"; it does not mean "I get to seat my own successor." Those are different, and the difference is exactly the founder-successor problem in miniature — you don't want to solve your own succession-control problem only to hand a smaller version of it to each pledger.

Put concretely, the refined Pledge 2 reads roughly as: *the signer commits, once the foundation is formed, either to accept appointment to the [medical/health] board seat, or to actively help identify and recommend a candidate of comparable qualifications for that seat, with the understanding that appointment of any such candidate is made by the foundation's board under its coöptatie procedure and subject to its independence requirements.* That keeps the flexibility you want, keeps the pledger genuinely on the hook for the qualification being filled, and keeps the final gate — is this person qualified *and* independent — in the board's hands rather than the departing pledger's.

One more small thing this surfaces: "comparable qualifications" is doing a lot of work and is fuzzy. "CEO of a major medical company" is a proxy for what you actually want in that seat — which might be *domain credibility in medical/health governance*, or *institutional weight*, or *regulatory fluency*. Worth writing down, per seat, what the qualification is actually *for*, so a replacement is judged against the real need rather than the job title. Otherwise you risk swapping one impressive title for another while losing the specific thing that seat was meant to bring.

So: keep the "serve or source a replacement" structure — it's better than a bare board pledge — but (1) route final appointment through the board's coöptatie, not the pledger's choice, and (2) define what each seat's qualification is actually *for*, so "comparable" has a real yardstick. Want me to fold this into the board-willingness letter draft — the serve-or-source language plus a short per-seat "what this qualification is for" line?

# Provo 42 Foundation — Control & Governance Architecture

**Version:** v0.2
**Date:** 2026-09-09 (Wednesday)
**Status:** Working design document. Not legal advice. Confirm all statutory, tax (ANBI), and notarial specifics with a Dutch stichting-specialist notary and a nonprofit tax advisor before acting.
**Prepared for:** David — Provo 42 Foundation *i.o.* (in formation)

---

## 0. The core design principle

The entire architecture rests on one idea:

> **Control is not surrendered by promise. It is surrendered by structure.**

A Dutch *stichting* has no owners and no members. Nobody holds shares, nobody can sell it, nobody inherits it. It is governed solely by its board (*bestuur*), and the board's power is fenced by the *statuten* (articles) and by law. The goal — *"me and my family are not in control"* — is therefore achieved through two levers working together:

1. **Who sits on the board.**
2. **What the *statuten* permit the board (and the founder) to do.**

Getting both right at the notary is the whole task. Everything below is an elaboration of these two levers.

---

## 1. Terminology reference

- **Stichting** — Dutch foundation; no owners, no members, governed by its board.
- **Stichting in oprichting** — "foundation in formation"; the pre-incorporation state.
- **i.o.** — the abbreviation appended during formation (e.g. *"Provo 42 Foundation i.o."*).
- **In formation** — English gloss (i.e. *being formed*), written as two words.
- **Statuten** — the articles / constitution; where control actually lives.
- **Bestuur** — the board.
- **Bestuurder** — a board member / director.
- **Coöptatie** — the sitting board appoints its own successors by vote.
- **Bekrachtiging** — formal ratification by the board of acts done before incorporation.
- **ANBI** — *Algemeen Nut Beogende Instelling*; Dutch public-benefit tax status.
- **Werkorganisatie** — the paid staff / working organisation (distinct from the board).

> **Liability note:** during the *i.o.* window the entity does not yet legally exist, so people acting on its behalf can be **personally liable** until the notarial deed passes and it is registered with the KvK.

---

## 2. Formation sequence (step by step)

1. **Draft the *statuten* first — before the notary.** This is the constitution and where the anti-capture design is encoded. Do not accept a boilerplate template for the governance clauses; they are the point.
2. **Pass the notarial deed + register with the KvK.** The foundation legally exists from the deed. As founder you hold a one-time power: appointing the first board. Spend it on independence, not retention.
3. **Seat an independent board and do not dominate it.** Odd number, ideally you a minority or off within a defined transition window written into the *statuten*.
4. **Separate governance from employment.** The person who *runs* the work (you, as paid staff) must not be the person who *controls* the body that hires and pays them.
5. **Get hired at market rate — cleanly** (see §6).
6. **Lock the family out structurally** (see §7).

---

## 3. The board

### 3.1 Size
- Legal minimum: **one** board member. Legal maximum: none.
- **Prefer odd numbers** (3, 5, 7) — even boards can deadlock, and a chair's casting vote quietly concentrates power.
- **Larger boards dilute the founder's vote.** On a board of three you need to flip only one other person; on a board of five you must move two. Size is itself an anti-capture lever.
- **Sweet spot for Provo 42: five.** Odd, meaningfully dilutes the founder, and fits the four domain seats (open-source governance, research, IP law, anti-fraud) plus one.
- Counter-pressure: **engagement.** An engaged five beats an absentee seven. Absentee seats re-concentrate power in whoever shows up — i.e. the founder.

### 3.2 Independence vs. conflict of interest — two different tests
- **Independence** is about *control*: is this person free of dependency on you or your family? Recruiting from your professional network is normal and fine. A CEO with their own standing and income is *independent* even if you know them — because you are not their paycheck.
- **Not independent:** someone who reports to you, depends on you as a major client, is in a reciprocal-favour dynamic, or shares a financial stake with you.
- **Conflict of interest** is per-*decision*, not per-person: even a fully independent member can be conflicted on a specific vote (e.g. the foundation transacting with their company). Handled by **disclose-and-recuse**, written into the *statuten*.
- **Aggregate risk:** if *every* seat is from your network, the board collectively reads as "David's people" even if each individual is clean. Fill at least some seats from outside your circle. Appearance matters for a governance-focused project.

### 3.3 Succession — the hinge clause
- Use **coöptatie**: the sitting board appoints successors by vote, founder recused or in the minority.
- Under coöptatie, "rotating out" a member is a **board act**, not a **founder act**. This is the difference between healthy renewal and the founder repacking the board.
- Add **term limits and staggered terms** so renewal happens on a schedule and nobody has to *choose* to remove anyone.
- **The first board-appointed independent who is not from your network is the moment "not in control" becomes true in force, not just in form.**

---

## 4. Two formation paths — a decision you must make

### Path A — Form with three (recommended)
You + two independents (e.g. a nonprofit CEO and a for-profit CEO) from day one.
- **Pro:** independence exists *in force* immediately — real board, real votes, real recusal. There is never a window where you are the unchecked whole of the foundation.
- **Con:** you cannot file until two others have signed on (this is what the board pledges in §9 are for).

### Path B — Form as sole founder, with your exit encoded in the *statuten*
Legally valid (a stichting may form with one director). Your retirement, succession, and board-building rules are written into the constitution and bind you the moment the deed passes.
- **Risk — total unchecked control during the sole window.** The anti-capture design exists only as text; no independent body is yet exercising it.
- **The hinge:** if the board can amend the *statuten* and you *are* the whole board, you could rewrite your own exit. **Therefore the amendment power must be locked** — bar amendment until the full board is seated, or require a quorum/supermajority a single member cannot meet, or **entrench** the retirement/succession clauses as unamendable.
- **Fragility:** a sole director who is incapacitated leaves the foundation unable to act. Add a fallback mechanism (external body or named procedure) that can seat a board.
- **Failure mode:** "temporary" sole control that quietly becomes permanent because it is convenient.

> **Guidance:** Path A matches the stated goal, because a seated independent board is a *fact* while an encoded retirement is a *promise* — and the whole session has chosen facts over promises. Use Path B only if there is a real reason to move now (grant deadline, timestamp/priority for the "first node" framing), and only with the amendment lock and a hard deadline for reaching three.

---

## 5. Founder's spend / founder's loan (~€4–5k already committed)

- Money already spent (largely pre-incorporation) cannot be a loan from an entity that did not yet exist. Document it now as **costs incurred by the founder on behalf of the foundation *i.o.***, then have the independent board **ratify** (*bekrachtiging*) it after formation.
- **Start an itemised ledger today** (date, amount, vendor, purpose, which foundation aim it served) while receipts and memory are fresh — the same receipts discipline as the corpus.
- A founder-creditor relationship is a **lever of influence** — the opposite of what you are building. Three options, cleanest first:
  1. **Gift (*schenking*)** — donate it, no claim remains. Cleanest for independence. Best match if losing it would not hurt the household.
  2. **Subordinated, interest-free, unsecured founder's loan** — keeps the claim but deliberately defangs it (repayment only when genuinely able, behind all other obligations). The disciplined middle path if €5k is real money you want back.
  3. **Expense reimbursement** — if it was operational cost, the board simply reimburses once funds exist.
- **Avoid** a normal loan with interest and repayment rights — it rebuilds the leverage you are giving up.
- **Whichever path: decided by the independent board with you recused.** Repaying/reimbursing the founder is a related-party transaction.

---

## 6. Getting hired at market rate — cleanly

The order of operations is what prevents self-dealing:
1. The **independent board** (you recused or already off) defines the role, the market rate, and the contract.
2. **Market rate needs an arm's-length basis** — a benchmark, salary survey, or external advisor's letter — documented in the minutes. (Receipts principle, applied to your own pay.)
3. **You do not vote on, negotiate both sides of, or set your own compensation.** The conflict-of-interest clause should render your participation formally void.
4. The contract is a normal employment/contractor agreement, signed by board members who are not you.
5. **You belong in the *werkorganisatie* (paid staff), not on the board**, for the paid role — ANBI limits board compensation to expenses plus modest attendance fees.

---

## 7. Locking the family out — structurally

Into the *statuten*:
- Family members **cannot be appointed** to the board.
- Related-party transactions require **unanimous approval of the disinterested members**, plus documentation.
- The **dissolution (*ontbinding*) clause** must send any remaining assets to a **similar-purpose foundation — never to the founder or heirs.** This is what stops the whole thing from ever being quietly converted back into family money. It is also an ANBI requirement.
- Your partner should **not** hold a seat, even transitionally — a founder-plus-family seat at formation is the most common way "not in control" silently fails on day one.

---

## 8. Fundraising

### 8.1 While *i.o.* — raise commitments, not cash
- An *i.o.* entity cannot safely hold others' money; funds collected into a personal account recreate the "founder controls the money" problem.
- **Prefer pledges/intent over cash.** No money moves until the foundation exists with a bank account in its own name.
- If money *must* be taken now, ring-fence it in a dedicated held-on-behalf-of account and have the board ratify the transfer after formation. Minimise this.
- **Do not run public crowdfunding while *i.o.*** Broad solicitation by a non-existent entity with no oversight is where things go wrong.
- Your own founder's spend is legitimate *i.o.* self-funding — just documented (§5).

### 8.2 After formation
- **ANBI status is the big strategic decision.** It makes donations tax-deductible, exempts the foundation from gift/inheritance tax on gifts received, and signals credibility. Its requirements (no single-person control, capped board pay, similar-purpose dissolution clause, public transparency) **reinforce** the anti-capture design rather than constrain it. Treat it as a near-term goal; confirm current rules with a nonprofit tax advisor.
- **Channels, best fit first:** grants (Dutch cultural funds, EU open-source/digital-heritage, research foundations) → donations (tax-deductible under ANBI) → earned/mission-related income (licensing, commissions; surpluses recycled, never distributed) → in-kind (compute, hosting, infrastructure).
- **Gift acceptance is a board decision.** A conditional gift ("fund you, but you must do X") is capture-by-donor — the external mirror of capture-by-founder. A written **gift-acceptance policy** lets the board decline strings.

---

## 9. The two pledges

Two **distinct** instruments — deliberately separate, because they carry different weight, and because someone who is both a major donor and a director holds two kinds of stake that the disclose-and-recuse machinery must see.

### Pledge 1 — Donation (light; about runway)
Intent to give once the foundation is legally formed (and ANBI-registered, if applicable). Good-faith, **no token euro** — Dutch law needs no "consideration," and a euro merely recreates the pre-incorporation cash-handling problem. Conditional on incorporation; the gift goes to the foundation's own account. The **wait is better for the donor**: a post-incorporation gift to an ANBI is tax-deductible; a euro to David-holding-funds today is not. Treat pledges as a runway indicator, not money in the bank — do not spend against them until converted.

> *Note: the symbolic €1 is theatre. Skip it.*

### Pledge 2 — Board commitment (heavy; about legal office)
An agreement, once the foundation exists, **either** to accept appointment to a specified board seat **or** to actively help identify and recommend a comparably-qualified candidate for that seat — **with appointment of any candidate made by the board under its coöptatie procedure and subject to its independence requirements.**

- Board membership is an **office with fiduciary duties and possible liability**, not a favour. The signer must understand *that*. The board-willingness letter doubles as a **filter**: someone who reads what the office entails and still signs is a far more reliable director.
- The "serve **or** source a replacement" structure makes the pledge robust — it commits the signer to the *seat profile*, not merely to their own attendance, and is an easier yes.
- **Guard the replacement route:** "source a candidate" must mean *surface for board vote*, **not** *seat my own successor*. Otherwise you solve your own succession-control problem only to hand a miniature version of it to each pledger.
- **Define what each seat's qualification is *for*.** "CEO of a major medical company" is a proxy — for domain credibility, institutional weight, or regulatory fluency. Write the real need per seat so "comparable" has a yardstick.
- Board pledges are also what make **Path A (form with three)** executable — and thus what dissolves the sole-founder risk in §4. **Over-subscribe them;** assume one falls through.

## 10. Open decisions (to resolve before the deed)

1. **Formation path:** A (form with three) or B (sole founder with entrenched exit)?
2. **Board size / composition:** confirm target of five; identify which seats come from outside your network.
3. **Founder's spend:** gift, subordinated loan, or expense reimbursement?
4. **ANBI:** pursue, and on what timeline?
5. **Copyright/licence holder** (from v0.1): hold in David's name and assign on incorporation (recommended), or the *i.o.* notice? Fill the legal-name placeholder.
6. **Professional advisers:** engage a stichting-specialist notary and a nonprofit/ANBI tax advisor before drafting the *statuten*.
